# Ecomzy-A-Shopping-Cart-Website
This is a shopping cart project where you can add items to the cart, remove them, and view the selected items in the cart. Additionally, the total of these items is also available. I have implemented these features using React Routes and Redux Toolkit, and I have designed the website using Tailwind CSS.
